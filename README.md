# DOS React starter kit

Welcome to [DayOne.pl](http://dayone.pl) React starter kit.
The only purpose of this project is to get you up and running with React JS project as fast as possible with some sane defaults.

4. Run `npm install` to fetch all dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start development server and edit some files
